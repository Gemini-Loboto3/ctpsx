# Clock Tower: The First Fear reversed engineered
A decompilation project of the PC version of the game, but using PlayStation assets for better visual fidelity and extras that came with that port.

## Working
* Main virtual machine commands;
* General API.

## Not working
* Controls (only left-right clicks are recognized via DInput8);
* Sprite code not fully done;
* No TMC (compressed sprites) support;
* Missing PSX specific code.
